# Identity Propagation Trust Framework

## Introduction

&emsp;With the growing popularity of protocols based on the OAuth 2.0 specification, there is a need for an interoperable standard that specifies how to convey information about the user from an identity provider (IdP) to a relying party (RP) across security domain boundaries. The problem is that designing such a system is challenging because OAuth 2.0 and OIDC are single-authority protocols.

&emsp;We introduce a dual-authority, NIST SP 800-63C conformant, trust framework that propagates identity information from an IdP to an RP when the RP and the IdP are not a single entity or are not under common administration.
