# Identity Propagation Trust Framework

## Introduction

&emsp;With the growing popularity of protocols based on the OAuth 2.0 specification, there is a need for an interoperable standard that specifies how to convey information about the user from an identity provider to the relying party across security domain boundaries. The problem is that such a system is challenging to design because OAuth 2.0 and OIDC are single-authority protocols. We introduce a dual-authority NIST SP 800-63C conformant trust framework that dynamically establishes trust between mutually unknown parties.
