# Identity Propagation and Assertions

## Introduction

With the growing popularity of protocols based on the OAuth 2.0 specification, there is a need for an interoperable standard that specifies how to convey information about the user from an identity provider (IdP) to a resource server (RS) across security domain boundaries.

## Motivation

To allow an IdP to provide authentication attributes to a number of separately-administered RSs through the use of assertions.

## Identity Propagation

In most architectures, the user's security context propagation stops at the IdP's authority boundaries. In an end-to-end identity propagation, the user's security context is extended to the RS, as illustrated in Figure&nbsp;1

The access token is exchanged at the IdP/STS for assertion in a JWT format that carries information about the client and user. This information can be used at the RS to decide which operations the client is allowed to invoke.

## Assertions

Assertions are statements from an IdP to an RS that contain information about a user and client. The RS uses the information in the assertion to identify the user and client and make authorization decisions about their access to resources controlled by the RS.

## Sequence Diagram

The sequence diagram illustrated in Figure&nbsp;2 shows an identity propagation flow for the user authenticated to the IdP to be able to access the resources stored on the RS using a client with a public identifier. The "/.well-known" mechanism and WebFinger queries are used as a means of proving ownership of the client identifier. The following are prerequisites for the given scenario:

1. The IdP, client and RS SHALL support the OAuth 2.0 Mutual-TLS Client Certificate-Bound Access Tokens specification.
2. The IdP SHALL support the Token Exchange extension of OAuth 2.0.
3. The subject of the public client certificate (OU and CN attributes) is used as a global client identifier e.g., OU=_fhir-client, CN=sandbox.example.com
4. The hash of the client's public key is published on the client domain (usually identical to the IdP host domain) as a public-key/hash attribute of JSON object which is discoverable via WebFinger using the client global identifier, e.g., https<nolink>://example.com/.well-known/webfinger?resource=acct:_fhir-client.sandbox.example.com&rel=public-key

The OIDC authentication flow is omitted for clarity.

There are other means of proving ownership of the client identifier, [DANEâ€”(DANCE WG)](https://github.com/umalabs/identity-propagation-and-assertions/blob/main/images/identity_propagation_flow_dane.svg), and [DNS TXT record](https://github.com/umalabs/identity-propagation-and-assertions/blob/main/images/identity_propagation_flow_dns_txt.svg).

## Usability Considerations

Using OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect technologies is an effective option to secure web APIs. From an API ecosystem perspective, the resource server is the API provider, and the client is the API consumer. The identity propagation system is helpful in B2B scenarios.

#### Trust First

The primary benefit of the identity propagation system is to address the problem of trust between the identity provider, the API provider, and the API consumer.

#### Third-Party Users to API

To identify the third-party users and clients, use composite API tokens generated by the identity propagation system instead of the API keys, user IDs, and passwords.

#### User to Third-Party APIs

Use a composite API token identifying the user and the client itself generated by the identity propagation system to access third-party APIs. Do not use an API key, user ID, and password.

## Conclusion

[Propagator](https://github.com/umalabs/propagator), a data transfer system, stands as a proof of concept of the Identity Propagation and Assertions architecture.

## Acknowledgment

[NIST Special Publication 800-63C](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63c.html), Digital Identity Guidelines: Federation and Assertions, has proven to be an abstract framework for the Identity Propagation and Assertions architecture.
