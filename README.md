# Global Reference Identity Protocol

## Abstract

Global Reference Identity Protocol (GRIP) is a token-based security protocol that authenticates service requests between untrusted hosts across the Internet.

## Introduction

With the growing popularity of communication systems, there is a need for an interoperable standard that specifies how to issue and convey information about the user from one service to another across security domain boundaries. Sometimes the final destination is not known at the time of identity information issuance, and that is where the relaying and resharing mechanism comes into play.

## GRIP Acronyms

GRIP uses special jargon. For the sake of brevity of this document, the following list of acronyms will be used:
<pre>
DNS     Domain Name System
CA      Certificate Authority
CN      Common Name
TLS     Transport Layer Security
mTLS    Mutual Transport Layer Security

SMTP    Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
FTP(S)  File Transfer Protocol (Secure)
HTTP(S) Hypertext Transfer Protocol (Secure)

IdP     Identity Provider
OIDC    OpenID Connect
RP      Relying Party
AS      Authorization Server
RS      Resource Server
STS     Security Token Service
JWT     JSON Web Token
JWK     JSON Web Key
</pre>

## Goals and Objectives

Enhance SMTP and FTPS protocols with a cross-domain authentication protocol. The authentication protocol should be application-protocol agnostic to support HTTP-based communication technologies. The resulting concept should support the relaying and resharing mechanism, which employs "request tokens" and "response tokens."

## Identity Propagation

In most security concepts and mechanisms, the user's security context propagation stops at the user's security domain boundaries. In end-to-end identity propagation, the user's security context is extended outside the user's security perimeter.

## Impersonation and Delegation

The OAuth 2.0 intrinsic delegation mechanism allows clients with the appropriate security token to impersonate the user or being delegated by that user. As a specific form of identity propagation, the [OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8693) specification describes impersonation and delegation, where the Client obtains a security token that allows it to act as a user in the case of impersonation or, in the case of delegation, allows it to act on behalf of the user. The output security token may carry the logical name of the target service for which it is constrained.

## Assertions

Assertions are statements from a token producer to a token consumer that contain information about the principal. In the Identity Propagation scenario, the resource server uses the information in the assertion to identify the Client and user to make authorization decisions about their access to resources controlled by that resource server.

## Identities and DNS-Bound Tokens

In most client-service-to-server-service communication scenarios, three identities are employed: user-identity, client-identity, and server-identity. Fundamentally, mTLS/TLS certificates resolve client-identity and server-identity, while tokens resolve user-identity. A DNS-Bound Token is a self-issued assertion in a JWT format signed by an mTLS private key that the client-service uses to authenticate to the server-service, while the mTLS public key hash is published on the client-service domain, where the CN attribute of the mTLS public key certificate is used as a global client identifier in respect of the service it represents.

## Nested, Chained Identity Propagation

The upcoming [JWT Embedded Tokens](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-yusef-oauth-nested-jwt-06.html) specification defines a mechanism for embedding tokens into a JWT token. The JWT token and the embedded tokens are issued by different issuers. Using such a mechanism with DNS-Bound JWT tokens, chained through issuer and audience claims, provides authenticity and integrity protection during identity propagation across multiple security domains.

## Self-Issued Identity Propagation

Using self-signed certificates ensures you can quickly start with the most straightforward identity propagation mechanism. The sequence diagram illustrated in Figure&nbsp;1 shows the self-issued identity propagation flow without AS and end-user involvement, where the Client requests access to resources stored on the RS on behalf of the impersonated user using a self-issued token.

The sequence diagram is self-explanatory.

## OAuth 2.0

Incorporating DNS-Bound Tokens into the Certificate-Bound Access Tokens extension of the OAuth 2.0 authorization protocol (see [RFC 8705](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8705)) adds more complexity to the identity propagation mechanism.

## 2-Legged Identity Propagation

The sequence diagram illustrated in Figure&nbsp;2 shows the 2-legged identity propagation flow without end-user involvement, where the Client requests access to resources stored on the RS on behalf of the impersonated user using a token generated on the AS.

The sequence diagram is self-explanatory.

## 3-Legged Identity Propagation

The sequence diagram illustrated in Figure&nbsp;3 shows the 3-legged identity propagation flow for the user authenticated at the IdP, where the Client requests access to resources stored on the RS on behalf of the authenticated user using a token generated on the AS.

The sequence diagram is self-explanatory; the OIDC authentication flow is omitted for clarity.

## Resource Server Discovery

The resource server is usually accessed using a service-specific protocol such as email or instant messaging. These protocols need to connect to a specific port in addition to connecting with a specific server.

DNS SRV record defines a symbolic name, the transport protocol, and the port and hostname to connect to for accessing the service. Therefore, DNS SRV records are the recommended way to enable the discovery of service-specific resource servers.

## Usability Considerations

The primary benefit of Identity Propagation and Assertions in the form of the constrained delegation concept is that it addresses the zero-trust between unrelated security domains. Using an mTLS and OAuth 2.0 technology is an effective option to secure service-to-service communication. From an OAuth 2.0 aspect, the outbound service is an OAuth 2.0 client, and the inbound service is an OAuth 2.0 resource server.

## Implementation

[Cargomail](https://github.com/cargomail-org/cargomail) — a privacy-aware email system, stands as proof of the concept of the GRIP mechanism.

## Conclusion

Given that GRIP is application-protocol agnostic, it can be applied to any TLS-protected communication protocol, including SMTP and FTPS. Generally speaking, GRIP allows identity-to-identity communication in a secure manner across the Internet.
