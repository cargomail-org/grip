note over TST:STS:\n• supports RFC 8705\n• supports the Token Exchange extension of OAuth 2.0
note over Client:Client:\n• supports RFC 8705\n• acts as a relying party in respect of the IdP in order to obtain\n  an access_token_with_user_claims\n• is registered at the IdP as a confidential client
note over RP:RP:\n• supports RFC 8705\n• uses the information in the assertion to identify the subscriber\n  and makes authorization decisions using a local ABAC engine.
TST<-Client:1. Send an HTTP request to the STS endpoint\n    • grant_type = token-exchange\n    • resource = a target RP URI\n    • requested_token_type = urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:access_token\n    • subject_token = access_token_with_user_claims\n    • subject_token_type = urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:access_token
TST->TST:2. Authorization decision:\n   1. evaluate the resource parameter\n   2. verify the subject_token signature\n   3. evaluate the subject_token claims

TST->TST:3. STS generates a certificate-bound access_token with these claims:\n    {iss, aud, sub, exp, nbf}\n    • iss is the URI that identifies who issues the access_token\n    • aud identifies the target service and it is the aud value from\n      the resource parameter\n    • sub identifies the subscriber by an email address that is extracted from\n      the access_token_with_user_claims\n    • exp, nbf are the standard JWT claims
Client<-TST:4. Return the access_token

Client->RP:5. Send an HTTP request to the RP with the access_token using mTLS
RP->RP:6. Authorization decision\n    1. verify the access_token signature\n    2. validate proof-of-possession\n    3. evaluate claims
RP->Client:7. Return the HTTP response, typically with 200, 201 status code
